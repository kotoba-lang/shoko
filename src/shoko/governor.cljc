  "ArchiveGovernor — the independent censor that earns archive-LLM the right
  to *propose* a draft. The LLM has no notion of ACL/grant state, tenant
  boundaries, or the no-actuation charter, so this MUST be a separate system
  (rules over the store's ground facts) able to *reject* a proposal and fall
  back to HOLD — the shoko analog of kekkai's TailnetGovernor / teian's
  BriefingGovernor / koyomi's ComplianceGovernor.

  The actor is **propose → draft only**. It never grants access itself;
  granting (`:file/share`) is ALWAYS routed to a human (the shoko analog of
  koyomi's always-human `:event/share` / teian's always-human
  `:deck/publish`). Below, HARD invariants force HOLD (a human cannot
  approve past a proposal that claims to have already shared, a share to an
  unregistered principal, or a file whose tenant doesn't match the activity
  driving it); a clean share still routes to a human (high-stakes).

  HARD invariants:
    :file/draft
      1. Subject-exists  — BOTH the file and the driving activity must
                           already be registered ground facts. Independent,
                           unconditional checks — fired regardless of what
                           `content`/`tenant` say, so a hallucinated file or
                           activity id can never silently no-op its way past
                           tenant-isolation below (mirrors koyomi's
                           missing-activity-violations / teian's
                           missing-artifact-violations / kekkai's
                           key-violations `:no-node` — the confirmed-bug
                           class this governor is built to avoid from the
                           start, see docs/DESIGN.md).
      2. No-actuation    — proposal :effect must be :draft, never :share (a
                           control-plane record, never an access grant).
      3. Tenant-isolation — the file's own registered :tenant must equal the
                           tenant derived from the driving activity's :repo.
                           A pure store-vs-store check (never trusts the
                           proposal's forwarded tenant), so it is exactly as
                           strong at draft-time as at share-time re-check.
    :file/share
      1. Subject-exists  — same file/activity-exist checks as :file/draft.
      2. Draft-exists    — there must already be a committed draft for the
                           file (`store/draft-of`) — otherwise this would be
                           a phantom share of nil content that still writes
                           a false :committed ledger fact.
      3. Share-requires-acl (deny-by-default) — the target :principal must
                           already have SOME grant recorded in shoko's own
                           grant ledger (on ANY file, not necessarily this
                           one) — kekkai.acl's deny-by-default mirrored onto
                           shoko's ACL: an entirely unregistered principal
                           string is a hard violation, never a soft signal.
      4. Tenant-isolation (recheck) — same store-vs-store check, re-run
                           fresh at share-time (not trusted from draft-time
                           approval) — teian's publish-time-recheck lesson
                           applied from the start.
    (any other op) — an unrecognized :op is itself a hard violation
                     (fail-closed: a not-yet-wired op must never silently
                     pass as clean).
  SOFT:
    Confidence floor → escalate.
    `:file/share` is high-stakes → ALWAYS human, independent of phase.

  Note on TOCTOU: this governor's checks are all fresh store reads run
  BEFORE any human-approval interrupt (govern always runs ahead of
  :request-approval in shoko.operation's StateGraph) — that is what makes
  the share-time recheck meaningful. The separate TOCTOU concern (a stored
  draft mutating WHILE a share approval sits in the interrupt) is guarded
  downstream, in shoko.operation/commit-effects!, by using the CHECKPOINTED
  `proposal` content captured at THIS governed moment, never a fresh
  post-approval store re-read (see shoko.operation docstring)."
