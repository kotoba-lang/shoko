(ns shoko.cli
  "Minimal JVM entrypoint for `shoko.query` against an EDN-seeded MemStore —
  no StateGraph/checkpointer/advisor spun up, just a status read. For a
  process boundary consumer that needs one file's draft status without an
  in-process require across runtimes.

  Usage: `clojure -M -m shoko.cli <ledger.edn> <file-id>` — prints the draft
  status (\"proposed\"/\"none\") and exits 0 on \"proposed\", 1 otherwise (so
  callers can also just check the exit code).

  <ledger.edn> holds the same shape as `shoko.store/demo-data`'s :files map
  plus an optional :drafts map (at minimum
  {:drafts {\"<file-id>\" {:status :proposed}}})."
  (:require [clojure.edn :as edn]

            [shoko.store :as store]))

        status (query/draft-status st file-id)]
