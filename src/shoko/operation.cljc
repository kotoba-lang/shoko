  "ArchiveActor — one draft/share operation = one supervised actor run, a
  langgraph-clj StateGraph. Two flows share one auditable graph:

    ingest (record-op):  intake → record → END
        `:file/register` records a `drive.model` file/folder EDN item as a
        durable ground fact. Always on, never an LLM call, never a grant.

    assess (assess-op):  intake → advise → govern → decide → commit|hold|approval
        archive-LLM (sealed) proposes a `:file/draft` (drive.model EDN
        content + confidence + cites + redactions), or (for `:file/share`) a
        pass-through recommendation over the already-committed draft, naming
        a `:principal`; ArchiveGovernor enforces no-actuation / subject-
        exists / share-requires-acl / tenant-isolation; the phase gate adds
        caution; granting access (`:file/share`) ALWAYS routes to a human
        (interrupt-before :request-approval), at every phase.

  Single invariant (the shoko analog of kekkai's no-data-plane-actuation /
  teian's no-actuation / koyomi's no-send):
    the actor never grants access the ArchiveGovernor would reject, and
    archive-LLM never actuates directly — committing a draft is data (a
    'casual commit'); only a human approval turns it into an access grant.

  TOCTOU note (koyomi confirmed-bug-#1 lesson, applied from the start):
  `commit-effects!`'s `:file/share` branch shares the `proposal` channel's
  `:content` — the EXACT content ArchiveGovernor/check already vetted for
  THIS request back at govern-time, before :request-approval's human-in-
  the-loop interrupt. `proposal` is a langgraph checkpointed state channel,
  so it survives the interrupt unchanged; it is NEVER re-read fresh from
  `store/draft-of` at commit time. A fresh re-read here would be a TOCTOU:
  if the stored draft were mutated while the approval sat in the interrupt
  (e.g. a legitimate concurrent `:file/draft` revision landing on the same
  file), a re-read would share whatever is CURRENTLY in the store — content
  that was never re-governed for this approval. See
  governor_contract_test's share-time TOCTOU test."

  `:file/share` reads content from `proposal`, NEVER from a fresh
