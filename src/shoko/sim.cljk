  "Demo: drive a file archive/share through one ArchiveActor.

    ingest             register a file (observe → ground fact)
    draft f-handbook   known tenant, clean → phase 3 auto-commits (a casual
                       commit)
    share f-handbook→alice   alice already has a prior grant (known
                       principal) → sharing is always high-stakes → human
                       sign-off → mock-archiveport grants + distributes
    share f-contract→mallory-external   an entirely unregistered principal
                       → HARD HOLD (un-overridable, share-requires-acl)
    draft f-rogue-tenant   registered under a DIFFERENT tenant than
                       act-archive's own repo → HARD HOLD (tenant-isolation)
    phase 0            draft in ingest-only phase → held (phase-disabled)
