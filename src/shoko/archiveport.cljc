(ns shoko.archiveport
  "ArchiveTarget port — the ONLY place a file actually leaves the building.
  An archive-LLM proposal is data (a `:draft` record) until a human approves
  sharing it; `share!` is called exactly once, after that approval, by
  `shoko.operation`'s commit step — the actuation (granting `principal`
  access + handing the delivered content to an injected Distributor).
  `propose-revision!` is the 'casual commit' analog (teian.deckport's/
  koyomi.scheduleport's): recording that an archival draft candidate exists,
  no external effect yet.

  `mock-archiveport` is the default — a deterministic in-memory target so
  the actor is runnable/testable with no network/creds. A real
  implementation would still call an injected Distributor fn (e.g. an email/
  notification API telling `principal` they now have access) for actual
  delivery, same injection shape as kekkai/teian/koyomi's ports — a live
  client is NOT shipped here (inject your own).

  `r2-archiveport` (JVM-only, below) IS a real, opt-in ArchiveTarget backed
  by a Cloudflare R2 bucket via R2's S3-compatible API — mock stays the
  default everywhere (shoko.operation/build's :archiveport opt), real R2 is
  only ever used when a caller explicitly constructs and injects one.
  shoko is a plain JVM library, not a Cloudflare Worker, so it cannot use
  the R2Bucket binding app-aozora's PDS Worker uses (ADR-2607071000,
  `.put`/`.get` on an injected binding) — it must speak R2's S3-compatible
  API over plain HTTP instead, which means signing every request with AWS
  SigV4. That signing is `kotoba-lang/sigv4` (ADR-2607254100).

  This file used to carry a function-for-function JVM port of
  `kotobase.sigv4`, written because that one was ClojureScript-only
  (`js/encodeURIComponent` et al) and so not `require`-able from a JVM host.
  The shared library is portable `.cljc` with crypto injected through a
  protocol — `javax.crypto` here, WebCrypto in a Worker — so the reason for
  the port is gone, and with it the port's obligation to stay in step with an
  original it could not see. What remains below is R2's own request shape,
  which is genuinely this repo's: an endpoint host rather than a URL,
  `Authorization` capitalised for `jvm-http-fn`, and byte[] payloads.

  Still JVM-only (`#?(:clj ...)`): shoko has no cljs/kototama build target
  today (deps.edn has no shadow-cljs; cli.clj/cacao.clj are already
  .clj-only)."
  ;; str/clojure.edn are used ONLY inside the #?(:clj ...) R2/SigV4
  ;; section below (see docstring above) — under a :cljs reading that whole
  ;; section vanishes, so clj-kondo's cljs-side pass would otherwise flag
  ;; these as unused (and a fully-conditional #?(:clj [...]) require, with no
  ;; :cljs branch, makes the :cljs ns's :require empty, which clj-kondo
  ;; rejects outright) — ^:clj-kondo/ignore is the correct scoped escape
  ;; hatch for a require that's genuinely host-specific by design.
