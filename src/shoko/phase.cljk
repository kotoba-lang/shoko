(ns shoko.phase
  "Phase 0→3 staged rollout, gating only the ASSESS ops (`:file/draft`
  `:file/share`). Recording a file/folder ground fact (`:file/register`) is
  always on — that is shoko's observe charter (durable ground facts). The
  phase only decides how much autonomy *drafting* has; granting access
  (`:file/share`) is never in scope for autonomy — it is a separate,
  always-human charter enforced by the governor's high-stakes flag, not by
  phase.

    0 ingest-only    — record files/folders; emit NO drafts yet (shadow
                       archive).
    1 assisted       — `:file/draft` allowed, but always human even to
                       commit just the draft content.
    2 assisted-draft — a clean+confident draft may auto-commit (it is just
                       proposed archival content sitting on the file for
                       review); sharing stays human.
    3 supervised     — same autonomy as 2; `:file/share` is high-stakes and
                       ALWAYS routes to a human (regardless of phase).")

  reachable by any ordinary caller that simply omits :phase -- not just
  malformed/malicious input -- so it must be the MOST CONSERVATIVE
  phase, never the most permissive. This was 3 (supervised, where
  :file/draft can auto-commit) until a live check confirmed a caller
  who forgets :phase silently got maximum autonomy instead of the safe
  default -- the same accidental-fail-open shape already found and
  fixed this session in the shared talent.phase template
  (gftd-talent-actor) and its siblings newscaster.phase, wami.phase,
  kyoninka.phase, sng.phase, itonami.phase, tayori.phase, goyoukiki.phase,
  and denrei.phase, which all inherited the same bug. 1 (assisted)
  matches those fixes. :file/share remains unaffected either way (never
  in any phase's :auto set -- granting access always requires a human)."
