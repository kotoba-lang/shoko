  "r2-archiveport — the real, opt-in Cloudflare R2 ArchiveTarget. Two layers:

  1. SigV4: that `sign-request` feeds kotoba-lang/sigv4 R2's request shape,
     and that what comes back round-trips through the same library's
     verifier — the independent recomputation R2 itself performs. The
     canonicalization golden vectors moved to that library with the code.
  2. r2-archiveport request-building against an INJECTED FAKE :http-fn (a
     plain closure capturing the request map, same convention
     cloudflare.client-test / cloud_itonami.mail-test use) — proves share!/
     fetch-file build well-formed SigV4-signed S3 requests (bucket/key/
     method/signed headers) with ZERO real network or credentials. The live
     round-trip against the actual R2 bucket is a separate manual
     verification step (see the ADR/task notes), never part of this suite."

;; ───────────────────────── SigV4 ─────────────────────────
;;
;; The canonicalization golden vectors that used to live here moved with the
;; code, to kotoba-lang/sigv4 (ADR-2607254100), where they are pinned against
;; AWS's own published reference signatures rather than against a sibling
;; implementation. Two cases this repo exercised that the library did not —
;; a colon in a key segment, and keyword-keyed query maps — went with them.
;;
;; What is tested here is what shoko still owns: that `sign-request` feeds the
;; library R2's shape correctly, and that the result is one a real endpoint
;; would accept. The round-trip through `sigv4.verify` is the independent
;; recomputation R2 performs, so a wrong header set fails here rather than as
;; an opaque 403 against a live bucket.
